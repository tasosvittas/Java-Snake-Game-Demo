# Java-Snake-Game-Demo
The all time classic game 'Snake', in Java. 

One of my first projects in Java, that I found one year later on my PC.
The graphics made with Java Swing (and with StackOverFlow's help :) )

The project also contains a score counter and as you see i build it on NetBeans Apatche.
